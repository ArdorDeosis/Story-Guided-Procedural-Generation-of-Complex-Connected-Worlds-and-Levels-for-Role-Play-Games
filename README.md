## Abstract

Procedural content generation had not only a rise in the games industry in recent years
but also became a topic in dedicated scientific work. Overlooking past game releases,
however, one might get the impression, that procedural content generation of whole
worlds on one hand and a strong story for the player to follow on the other hand are
mutually exclusive.

This work presents an overview of established methods, concepts, and techniques
in the field of procedural content generation. Furthermore, it presents an approach
to implement a generator for a whole, complex and interconnected world for a roleplaying game. This partly includes the storyline the player follows. The story is used
as a scaffolding for the world to be wrapped around so that the world is best suited to
accommodate the story.

The approach is divided into three main steps: The generation of the storyline, the
generation of the world, according to the storyline, and the generation of single levels
according to the world, including detailed information on every step.
